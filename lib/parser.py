Hello, and welcome

This is a log message that will appear in before any action is taken.

Now let's read some files...

read file1.html,file2.html

Now, create a new file with the following content.

We can set any delimiter we want, but it must be repeated at the end of the content.

write filename.html DelimiterWordThatCanBeAnything
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
DelimiterWordThatCanBeAnything
After that, remove the newly created file.
remove filename.html
Finally, set a commit message and a comment.
commit The commit message

comment delim
I wan to
exit
delim
exit
And that concludes our test.
